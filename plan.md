## Key Principles for Execution

1. **Learn by building.** Every concept should result in code or a project within 48 hours.
2. **Depth before breadth.** Master one level before expanding horizontally.
3. **Spaced repetition.** Revisit fundamentals periodically — they compound.
4. **Ship publicly.** GitHub commits, blog posts, and videos create accountability.
5. **Read source code.** Study how React, Linux, Redis, and PyTorch actually work.
6. **Solve hard problems.** Competitive programming, system design interviews, and research papers build muscle.
7. **Teach to learn.** Explaining concepts reveals gaps in understanding.
8. **Stay uncomfortable.** If it feels easy, you're not growing.
